# astro_python
# Work done for Astronomical calculations using Python. Includes membership classification of NGC 6633, radial velocity graphs and universe expansion models.

#### "classification.ipynb" This project combine data science, data sets, statistical analysis with astronomy. Determining star membership based on 3 characteristics. Starting membership on database: More than 6500 members. 

Step 1: Making parallax cuts based on the GAIA dr3 dataset and using statistical analysis, clear Gaussian cut. Calculated parallax: 2.74725274725 milliarcseconds. 
Final applied parallax cuts: 1.4 and 3.1
Step 2: Making proper motion cuts. Right skewed distribution. Final cut made at 15 PM. value. Cuts match 350 members remain.
Step 3: Making magnitude cuts using photometry. Based on the statistical trends & correspondence to the image itself cut off magnitude set as 17.8

Cuts made using parallax, proper motion and magnitudes reveal that in an area of 3.5â€™ there are 70 stars that are definitely a member of the open cluster NGC 6633.


#### "galaxy_models.ipynb" This notebook solves for bound, unbound and critical universes using parametric equations and numerical integration and plots the expansion models of the bound, unbound and critical universes. 

#### "radial_velocity.ipynb" This notebook plots the radial velocity of a galaxy, where V is in km/s and R is in kpc.
